# nenuzhno engine

This repository contains the old discontinued codebase of my training engine/framework. I'm currently working on a new iteration of an engine, with better architecture (that's what i'm counting on).

I put it here so as not to lose by accident.

Writen in C++. Uses OpenGL/ES 2.

## Dependencies

MinGW-W64

GLFW 3.3

GLM 0.9.9.0

GLEW 2.0

**StarFleet** - space battles "game". With basic fighter AI, but withous gameplay

**tpsGame** - atempt to make real game. With bullet phisics, text map format, even menu

**VolLight** - Volumetric lighting

**gravity** - 2D simulation "game"

**skinning** - loads mdl files (Source engine) and renders some animation

**SSR** - kinda screen space reflections

**path_tracing** - uses glsl shader for ray trace

**blur-test** - atempt to do bokeh
